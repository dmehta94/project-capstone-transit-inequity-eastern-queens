## Data Science Immersive | Capstone, Part 4
Your project criteria were derived from the following standards, taken from our data science workflow:

- [ ] Gather Data
- [ ] Explore Data
- [ ] Model Data
- [ ] Evaluate Model

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

## Performance Evaluation


#### RUBRIC

| Score | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **0** | *Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item.* |
| **1** | *Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **2** | *Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **3** | *Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration.* |


#### REQUIRED
1. Begin with an executive summary:
   - What is your goal?
   - What are your metrics?
   - What were your findings?
   - What risks/limitations/assumptions affect these findings?
   
2. Walk through your model step by step, starting with EDA.
   - What are your variables of interest?
   - What outliers did you remove?
   - What types of data imputation did you perform?

3. Summarize your analysis, including:
   - model selection
   - implementation
   - evaluation
   - prediction/inference

4. Clearly document and label each section
   - Logically organize your information in a persuasive, informative manner.
   - Include notebook headers and subheaders, as well as clearly formatted markdown for all written components.
   - Include graphs/plots/visualizations with clear labels.
   - Comment and explain the purpose of each major section/subsection of your code.
       - *Document your code for your future self, as if another person needed to replicate your approach*

5. Host your notebook and any other materials in your own public Github Repository.
   - Include a technical appendix, inlcuding links and explanations to any outside libraries or source code used.
   - Host a local copy of your dataset or include a link to a remotely hosted version.

#### BONUS
6. Describe how this model could be put into production. Consider:
   - How could you continue to validate your model's performance over time?
   - What steps might you need to take to productionize your model for an enterprise environment?
   - How would you deploy your model publicly? What could you do to setup your model and share it online right now?

7. Create a blog post of at least 1000 words summarizing your approach in a tutorial format and link to it in your notebook. 
   - In your tutorial, address a slightly less technical audience; think back to Day 1 of the program - how would you explain and walk through your capstone project to your earlier self?

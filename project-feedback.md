> _Every student should have a chance to understand how they're doing and to get valuable feedback on the work they've done from trusted mentors in the classroom._

Specific, timely feedback is critical to student learning. Our goal is to provide meaningful suggestions and guidance to all of our students. While there will undoubtedly be nuances in individual student portfolio evaluation, use these guidelines to ensure that your students get the personalized feedback they deserve.

Our evaluation approach pairs a numeric "grade" (useful for tracking student performance over the course) with instructor-provided qualitative feedback (useful for coaching and improving student performance).

Below, we'll walk you through:

1. [What to Grade](#what)
2. [Why we Grade](#why)
3. [How to Grade](#how)
4. [How to Deliver/Discuss Grades](#feedback)

<a id='what'></a>
## What to Grade
In DSI, students are required to complete **all 5 deliverables** from their Capstone Project, as well as **80% of all additional assignments**, including Unit Projects and any other required labs or assignments. 

#### Course Completion Requirements
- [ ] Unit Projects 1-4
- [ ] Capstone Deliverables 1-5

These assignments contain requirements and rubrics you can use to evaluate student performance.

#### Optional Assignments

Any assignments outside of the unit projects and capstone are **optional** and do not require your specific feedback. Labs, homework, and other group activities are core **student-led** components of the curriculum. In other words, it is in the student's best interest to complete these as part of their dedicated practice to attaining the competencied needed to enter the field of data science.

## Why to Grade

Below are a few high level principles and best practices for providing project feedback:

#### Guiding Principles for Project Feedback

- Provide structured feedback
- Define clear targets for student performance
- Verify continued progress and improvement throughout the course

#### Best Practices for Project Feedback 

- Review project requirments and rubrics with students early on, so that they know how they will be assessed.
- Focus your project feedback on **required** project components
- Work with your local team to provide timely, targeted feedback for **every** student

## How to Grade



#### How to Grade Projects

1. Make a copy of the relevant project rubric.
2. Score project requirements using rubric criteria.
3. Provide at least one comment on major deliverable portions of the requirements. We recommend following a "glow/grow" template, with one item of praise and one suggestion for improvement.


#### Our Rubrics
We use a simple 3 point scale. Using the guideline below, assess how well students performed on all required sections on a scale of 0-2, and share those scores in your feedback:

Score  | Expectations
--- | ---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_


#### More Tips for Providing Project Feedback

- Provide precise praise
- Identify action step for improvement
- Give context as to why what action step is important
- End with a targeted question related to the action step, that tests whether the student has understood the feedback.

  - **Good Example**: "Great work! Your code is well organized. Good use of breaking tasks into separate functions. I see that in your app.js file you used the variable name x on line 84. Consider using more descriptive variable names. As a code reviewer, this would jump out at me. I want to know what every variable contains just by looking at the variable name itself. I do see some other descriptive variables! If we were to refactor this code, what would you want to rename x on line 84?"

  - **Poor Example**: "Great Work! You’re doing a good job with all this. Do you have any questions about anything?"

## How to Deliver Feedback

Instructors should devote specific time to check in with students before and after project submission. 

#### Beforehand

Many instructors have found the use of a *daily stand* method useful for holding students publicly accountable to incremental progress on projects during the week leading up to a deadline. This is a good chance to briefly discuss student progress, next steps, and blockers.

Instructors may optionally choose to conduct these check-ins individually during office hours.

#### After Project Submission

Once instructors have had a chance to review student work and are ready to provide feedback, we recommend scheduling a series of 1:1's to go over the project rubric and feedback together. Students should ideally have up to 30 minutes to review their project evaluation or walk through a code review with their instructional team.


#### Tips on Providing Feedback

Project feedback is not troubleshooting time. Instead, the goal is to review the student's code and talk about actionable feedback for enhancing the student's project in the future. Below is a sample framework instructors can use to discuss 

- __Student (10 mins)__: Prompt the student walk through and/or defend their project / model / code.

- __Student (10 mins)__: Ask the student answer some sample questions:
  - What do you like most about your project?
  - What would you change if you started from scratch?
  - What would you like to add when you have more time?
  - What goals would you set for yourself for your next project or a future version?

- __Instructonal Team Member (10 mins)__: Talk through the evaluation, share a “glow and grow”.
  - Make it personal – what about the project was exciting or intriguing?
  - Share any highlights and positive areas (“glow”) where the student went “above and beyond” the requirements
  - Share growth areas around time management, workflow, or project approach
  - Share growth areas around technical skills and ways to remediate any difficulties the student encountered
  - Help the student prioritize and identify which growth area is most important to focus on before the next project. 
  - Review their performance against the requirements and explain any rubric scores, if necessary.
  - Ask them to compare their progress against any goals they set previously, if applicable.

- __Instructional Team Member__(Followup): Be sure to report a summary of your evaluations using your local course tracker. This will help your team identify trends in student performance over time.

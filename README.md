## Overview
The newly announced congestion tax to enter lower Manhattan aims to restrict private vehicular traffic through New York City, but instead will reroute arterial traffic through various less-traveled routes, making commutes from places like Eastern Queens, where there is no real subway access, especially difficult. In order to complement the state's strategy to reduce arterial traffic, we aim to optimize bus routes across the Eastern Queens Transit Desert to provide better access through to the other boroughs and swift subway access, ensuring that highly congested areas receive adequate service.

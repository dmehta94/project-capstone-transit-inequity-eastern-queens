## Overview

In the field of data science, good projects are **practical**. Your capstone project should be manageable and affect a real world audience. This might be a domain you are familiar with, a particular interest you have, something that affects a community you are involved in, or an area that relates to a field you wish to work in.

One of the best ways to test ideas quickly is to share them with others. A good data scientist has to be comfortable discussing ideas and presenting to audiences. That's why for Part 1 of your Capstone project, you'll be preparing a lightning talk on some potential interest areas and datasets.

This deliverable will provide you with guidance to help you select an awesome topic and begin to build a polished Capstone project. 

**Goal**: Host a lightning talk presentation describing *at least two* project proposals, including associated data, goals, audiences, and metrics.

## Requirements
1. Prepare a slide deck and host a 3-5 minute lightning talk on **at least two** potential topics for your DSI capstone project. For each topic, define **all** required areas:

2. Topic 1
   - Problem Statement
   - Potential Audience 
   - Goals
   - Success Metrics
   - Data Source(s)
   
3. Topic 2
   - Problem Statement
   - Potential Audience 
   - Goals
   - Success Metrics
   - Data Source(s)

#### BONUS
4. Beyond the two required topics, what other potential topics might you explore? (e.g. 3 or more)
5. For all datasets, identify their source, format, and necessary action items to obtain or access them.
6. Create a blog post of at least 500 words (and 1-2 graphics!) that describes your project idea, data, and audience. Link to it in your presentation appendix.
 
 ***Remember, if you can't find data to support your topic, then you can't move forward.***

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

**Begin by Asking:**
- What is the scope of the need or problem I wish to investigate?
- Who is this for? Who is impacted or affected by this data? Who would benefit from this model?
- What are my goals for this investigation?
- What does success look like? How will I know if my model performs well?
- Where will I find data for this project? Is the data available?

**For the Bonus, Ask:**
- What format is the data in? What specific steps do I need to take to access it?
- How will I explain this project to outside audiences?

**Other Tips:**
- For your 1st potential topic, start with an idea, then look for potential data that could be used to support that idea.
- For your 2nd potential topic, reverse the process; look for interesting data and then extrapolate problems it could solve and audiences it could impact.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the requirements above using the below rubric.

#### RUBRIC
| Score | Interpretation |

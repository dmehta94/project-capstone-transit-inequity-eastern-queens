## Overview

In the field of data science, good projects are **practical**. Your capstone project should be manageable and affect a real world audience. This might be a domain you are familiar with, a particular interest you have, something that affects a community you are involved in, or an area that relates to a field you wish to work in.

One of the best ways to test ideas quickly is to share them with others. A good data scientist has to be comfortable discussing ideas and presenting to audiences. That's why for Part 1 of your Capstone project, you'll be preparing a lightning talk on some potential interest areas and datasets.

This deliverable will provide you with guidance to help you select an awesome topic and begin to build a polished Capstone project. 

**Goal**: Host a lightning talk presentation describing at least two proposed project ideas and associated data, goals, audiences, and metrics.

## Requirements

Prepare a slide deck and host a lightning talk on 2-3 potential topics for your DSI capstone project. For each topic, define:

- Problem Statement
- Potential Audience 
- Goals
- Success Metrics
- Possible Data Sources

- Define your problem statement, goals, and success criteria.
- Describe 1-2 potential datasets that address your problem statement
- Identify a potential audience of stakeholders who may be interested in your findings
- Create a 3-5 minute presentation slide deck
- Be prepared to discuss and defend your topic & dataset(s)

#### Bonus:
 - For all datasets, identify their source, format, and necessary action items to obtain or access them.
 - Create a blog post of at least 500 words (and 1-2 graphics!) that describes your project idea, data, and audience. Link to it in your presentation appendix.
 
 ***Remember, if you can't find data to support your topic, then you can't move forward.***

## Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Presentation Slide Deck of 3-5 minutes, including:
 - Description, problem statement, audience, goals, & success metrics.
 - 1-2 Potential Datasets related to topic
- Presentation should be prepared by the end of Week 6

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

Ask:
- What is the scope of the need or problem I wish to investigate?
- Who is this for? Who is impacted or affected by this data? Who would benefit from this model?
- What are my goals for this investigation?
- What does success look like? How will I know if my model performs well?
- Where will I find data for this project? Is the data available?

Bonus:
- What format is the data in? What specific steps do I need to take to access it?
- How will I explain this project to outside audiences?

Tips:
- For your first potential topic, start with an idea, then look for potential data that could be used to support that idea.
- For your next potential topic, reverse the process; look for interesting data and then extrapolate problems it could solve and audiences it could impact.
